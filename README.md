# Variational-Bayes-Auto-Encoding
Final project of the course Information Theory and Inference in the Physics of Data master degree at University of Padova.

Description
We utilize both PyTorch and TensorFlow to implement Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with both fully connected (flattened) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. These models are evaluated on multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Mini Speech Commands. We then compare the performance of the models across these datasets to gain insights into their efficiency and accuracy.

Language
Python (TensorFlow & PyTorch)
